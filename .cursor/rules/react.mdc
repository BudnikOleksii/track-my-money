- Use functional components with hooks instead of class components
- Use custom hooks for reusable logic
- Use fragments to avoid unnecessary DOM elements
- Use proper list rendering with keys
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Use kebab-case for naming all folders in the project. (e.g., about-us)
- Use kebab-case for naming all no React components files (e.g., check-is-dynamic-route.ts)
- Use UpperCamelCase for naming React components ( e.g., AnchorScroll.tsx)
- Always name the props type as Props and define it using an interface.
- Use FC with a generic type such as FC<Props> or FC<PropsWithChildren<Props>> for typing React components.
- Use naming export in React Components (e.g., export const AboutUs: FC = () => (...))
- Use naming export in other cases
- Whenever possible, use interfaces. If this is not possible: you need to make an Omit, you need a union type, etc., - you can use type.
